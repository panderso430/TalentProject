            <h2>Learn to Learn Drill 1</h2>

            <p> Recently since the Galvanize Web Development Program began , I have learned a great deal about computer technology. In the beginning, I have seen engineers operating through the terminal, however, I was highly intimidated based on the fact
                that I am so accustom to navigating on a computer with a mouse. I really enjoy organizing my files and directories in this manner, because the the amount of time saved from not moving the mouse is tremendous. The next thing that I have
                learned was the applications and other installs such as oh-my-zsh, node VSC, bash, that make using the terminal more intuitive with colors and error messages. Pushing files to repositories on github is a crucial part of tracking changes,
                and individuals to conduct execution with out contaminating the master. This is a huge advantage when working with a team Here I have now learned how to utilize HTML and CSS in combination to create layouts on the browser. The method that
                I have been currently experimenting with is flex-box. It is a tool set in Css that allows for you to adjust content justify-content and align-items. The concept of using node and repil to run java script are also two ways that I have not
                been exposed to. Some new commands that I have been learning in JavaScript are split, join, trim, pop, push

                <p> Set the Stage Setting the stage for me means close all unnecessary tabs on your browser, open a new window to start fresh, close email and facebook. Eat properly, set timers in order to compartmentalize time and get the maximum productivity
                    out of the time spent. The idea to me means make your learning environment to assist you to be the most productive and effective as possible. For this exercies, I have also leaned how to take a screen recording and upload videos to
                    youtube the video showing me setting the stage is attached as link below.</p>

                <p> Reflection What I reflect on is the fact that a process like this is not an instantaneous result. There is a lot of struggling. One must get out of a fixed brain.</p>

            <h2>Learn to Learn Drill 2</h2>

            <p> Something that stuck out to me when I was creating my goals prioritizing. this new concept has helped a lot. What is specific has been a big issue. Handleing things in a timely manner is something that I have under estimated in the last to
                do list. There are a few things that I have needed to do that took far to much time. 2 Goals for today Submit this drill which is DRILL2 Speak with Jess about my enrollments . I was capable to achieve most of my goals from the previous
                to do list that more Realistic. Jess was priority and this was accomplished Re Assessment What is achievable is to accomplish 2 essential goals before midnight. What has been going well is that my support system as I have reenforced. They
                have been able to help me narrow down my issues, as well as they have made me aware of the most important topics. Having a support system helps eliminate some of the stress of things we don't have time for, Things I need to improve on
                is to limit the level of stress, and simply complete task. Tomorrow I will not panic as much and ask advise before getting to stuck.(Get in the QUE) This is important because of the time and frustration factor. I understand legal issues
                clearer. Compartmentalizing Organizing my thoughts has been a technique that I would consider as a win. Goals Specific: the task at hand was to finish this 2nd short-term goal drill. I have submitted before and now I see where the slackbot
                is helpful completing the failed task. When it comes to being specified this is priority. -Measurable: this goal is measurable because it just required a reflection -Achievable: It is possible to achieve this goal in a timely manner. -Realistic:
                To get this and one more drill to pass is a realistic goal, however requires attention to detail. -Timely: Your goals are what you need to learn now. Reflection Were the goals met? Yes or no. -YES Yes What went well? The student describes
                at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' The learning experience is a giant win as well as utilizing my support. What didn't go well? Failing these goals and using to much time. What will you do differently
                tomorrow? Check my submissions prior to submissions

            <h2>Learn to Learn Drill 3</h2>

            <p> Read the instructions for the three drills that I intend to complete before lunch. Including the drills I have failed. The first thing I will do is make sure that I have responded to all of my slack messages from Galvanize, then check my personal
                emails. After I have completed that, I will practice to utilize the new techniques that I have learned in navigating files. I will represent how I can navigate files and switch programs. I have set up my dock to be on the left side in
                order to create a little more real estate on my screen, as well as I have made my settings. ### Reflection The complications that I faced were that I did not turn off my cell phone notifications and it distracted me. The biggest problem
                was that I had some one helping me and it distracted both of us, which means a waste of time. The video upload was a waste of time I will make a different graphic representation next time. ### Positives I was able to close applications
                that were not serving me. I am now a little more comfortable utilizing help that this atmosphere provides What was one of the best portions of this exercise was I completed a portion of my contract. I was able to find a space that I could
                concentrate, the space, the environment change was great in the fact that it eliminated distractions. The repetition was not so time consuming and beneficial. One of the key point is the techniques using *.* I am more comfortable with
                asking for help.</p>

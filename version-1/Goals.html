        <h1>Set simple short-term goals </h1>
        <p>
            My simple short term goals for today will follow my interpretation the SMART concept(Specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timeline) to set goals. I have to recognize that I make massive to do list and rarely accomplish the tasks that are priority.
            The problem is that I can make my self aware of the task at hand however, I need to specify how to execute. The plan must be measurable, manageable and calculated. No more making vague plans without a defined purpose. Creating a hierachy is
            essential to accomplishing the maximum. If I can clear up the essential issues there will be more time for personal issues.</p>

            <h2>FEB 23 2018</h2>
            <p>Five short-term goals </p>
            <p>1-Finish One html Drill</p>
            <p>2- Re assess the Git Drills that were sent back for corrections.</p>
            <p>3- Attend the Global Legal Hackathon.</p>
            <p>4- Begin 2nd meet-up drill.</p>
            <p>5- Spend 1 hour organizing files and folders.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <p>A long-term goal that I am aiming for is to finish the Project One. I intend to do this by executing each small term goal at a time. This will eventually conclude my current and biggest issue. From there I will reassess. The overall goal is
                to become a comprehensive web developer. I understand that coding is the one and only international language, and that the world must adapt to the concept. I am unsure of what the end result will bring, however, becoming a web developer
                will allow me to pursue many other of my passions. I have spent enough time on this task I will compartmentalize and move forward. </p>
            <p>had troubles completing everything that I thought I set goals for. I was to busy to attend a meet - up last night, but I have a variety of options to attend.(LOSS) I have been able to utilize my connections to accelerate my learning. The two
                goals that I have achieved in this set of short-term goals are : - Spend 1 hour organizing files and folders. (WIN) - Re assess the Git Drills that were sent back for corrections. (WIN) I have spent loads of time working with navigating
                files, I passed the git drill I was struggling with as well as the meet-up reflection. I was able to achieve these goals in a timely manner, because I specified the priorities and was able to manage my time. I thought that I was able to
                follow my short-term goals based on the SMART method. Tomorrow I will set less goals and make sure I accomplish them.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>May 1</h2>
        <p>Something that stuck out to me when I was creating my goals list was a quote "managing how you thinkâ€”rather than what you think" this mind state can transform your life. What is specific has been a big issue. Handleing things in a timely manner
            is something that I have under estimated in the last to do list. There are a few things that I have needed to do that took far to much time.</p>

        <p>2 Goals for today - Submit this drill. - Practice FlexBox techniques. I was capable to achieve most of my goals from the previous to do list that more Realistic</p>

        <h3> ReAssessment</h3>
        <p>What is achievable is to accomplish three essential goals before midnight. What has been going well is that my support system. They have been able to help me narrow down my issues, as well as they have made me aware of the most important topics.
            Having a support system helps eliminate some of the stress of things we don't have time for, Things I need to improve on is to limit the level of stress, and simply complete task. tomorrow i will not panic as much and ask advise before getting
            to stuck. This is important because of the time and frustration factor.</p>

        <p>Compartmentalizing and Organizing my thoughts has been a technique that I would consider as a win. Goals Specific: the task at hand was to finish this short-term goal drill. I have submitted before and now I see where the slackbot is helpful completing
            the failed task. When it comes to being specified this is priority. -Measurable: this goal is measurable because it just required a reflection -Achievable: It is possible to achieve this goal in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>Realistic: To get this and one more drill to pass is a realistic goal, however requires attention to detail. </p>

        <p>Timely: Your goals are what you need to learn now. Were the goals met? Yes or no. </p>

        <p>YES, the flexbox went slower than expected. What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' The learning experience is a giant win as well as utilizing my support. What didn't go
            well? Failing these goals and using to much time. What will you do differently tomorrow? Check my submissions prior to submissions</p>

        </p>

        <h2>Today May 11</h2>

        <p>Today is the last day of week three and I have set three specific goals. I have been noticing that I have been neglecting some of the learn to learn skills I have acquired since February. I need to set the stage more often by clearing the stage
            more often. I will clear my desktop three times during the work day to minimize distractions and frustrations. I want to set a reasonable goal when it comes to publishing my website. I just want to finish one component like the bio section.
            I am stuggling with css therefore I will attend the breakout this afternoon to improve my skills. Dan is the instructor there for it will be great.</p>


        <p>1. Finish One out of four of the pages for the first project.
            <p>2. Practice setting the stage at least 3 times before the end of day.
                <p>3. Attend A Breakout-CSS Grid

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Today it was very effective to set the stage more often. I noticed I was trying to work on three projects at the same time, and once I limited the amount of windows open is super helpful. I typically have at least three quarters of
                        my windows open that are from previous research. Most of which can be eliminated to move forward. I was unable to finish my bio to the level of professionalism I desire. I showed up to the CSS Grid breakout, and I learned several
                        new techniques that will help me further my website.</p>

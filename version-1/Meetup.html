            her company depends on SEO and how to brand things as well as outrank other wed sites. There are a few techniques that we discussed that we could help each other out.

            <p> I learned about Google ad words and how they can be used to boost content on the web. The power of SEO, locally, nationally, and internationally. Meaning there are ways to use photo location to link photos and business locations. This helps
                with maps, directions, and location value. Companies like Yelp would utilize this type of data.

            <p>People I Met I got meet four people that are part of the Galvanize family. James Schultz, James Man (instructors at Galvanize) and Coleman, Rylie (G77 Students).
            </p>
            <p>What I Learned I always envisioned that margin was a blank area that surrounded the entire css element, however one can specify which direction and how large the margin should be. I was attempting to make a places next to an placeholder image
                on the right. I began trying to make a grind or flex content inside a container when all I needed to do was to push the placeholder over with the margin-right command. Padding deals with the text or objects inside a box, it is possible
                to have a universal padding or specify for each side.</p>

            <p>hov- new command that is slightly interactive. I was able to change the hover over the menu button. I have been stuck on the concept of adjusting sizes with px. This is a way, however I believe that it is looked down upon. There are mush more
                efficient methods to resize objects and text. em Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font). vw Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport vh Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
                % Relative to the parent element. When dealing with the background, one can change the css by each element or create the body to have a single background color. Later I have played with using images as backgrounds. There are ways to divide
                the image and repeat as a pattern. Floats and wraps can be a more effective way of fitting content inside a container in that it can eliminate align-content command. FLex-Box froggy and Grid Garden are great online tools to help learn
                layout tools in CSS.</p>

            <p>Questions I Have Where are some other courses that I can attend for materalize and bootstrap? Are there layout programs that can take a wireframe and produce a website layout?
